# Move files based on partial name match

The program will grab any files that mention the name "Harlo" from the source folder "Data" and send them to the destination folder "Data" and create a destination folder named "Harlow"(Example: both 123Harlo.pdf and Harlo90_.pdf files will be transferred to the Harlow folder)
