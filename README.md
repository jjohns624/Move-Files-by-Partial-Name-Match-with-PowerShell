# Move files based on partial name match
Allows the user to take the first 5 letters of their file name and direct the file to the associated folder. This allows the user transfer and organize files at scale after running the code.
Example: The program will grab any files that start with "Harlo" from the source folder "Data" and send them to the destination folder "Data" and create a destination folder named "Harlow"(Example: Harlo files will be transferred to the Harlow folder)
