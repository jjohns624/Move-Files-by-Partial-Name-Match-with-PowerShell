This program takes files that have a specific name (like "Harlo") from a folder called "Data" on the computer, and puts them into a new folder called "Harlow" on the same computer. It does this by using a special list (called a "map") that matches the first five letters of a file name with the correct new folder name. It also checks if the new folder already exists and creates it if it doesn't. Finally, it moves the files from the "Data" folder to the correct new folder. If there's already a file with the same name in the new folder, it doesn't move the file and gives an error message.
