# Move files based on partial name match
Allows the user to search for 5 continuous letters or less in a file name and direct the file to the associated folder. This allows the user transfer and organize files at scale.
The program will grab any files that mention the name "Harlo" from the source folder "Data" and send them to the destination folder "Data" and create a destination folder named "Harlow"(Example: both 123Harlo.pdf and Harlo90_.pdf files will be transferred to the Harlow folder)
